## Overview

- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

This one was a lot of work compared to the other challenges I've completed on FrontendMentor, but it was a lot of fun!

This is my first stab at using styled-components, a CSS-in-JS library as well as my first attempt at a multi-step form. I ended up using React Context for managing the state. Styled-components, once I got used to it, was very nice to use, and I may consider using it over tailwind on my next project. My one gripe was that it made the code feel pretty bloated with all the styling in the same document. The most challenging part of this project was getting the layout shift from 375px to 1440px correct.
